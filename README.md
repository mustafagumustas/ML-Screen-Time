# ML-Screen-Time

    In this repo I'm trying to create a program that detects faces in videos, then calculates each persons total 
    time in the video. There will be comparisons in the future. Here I will be publishing my progress.
    
## Data Collection and Augmentation
    I will try my programs with the camera first, then give the videos as input. But because there are not much data
    for the algorithm I will apply some augmentation methods.
