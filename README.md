# Screen Time Project

This project aims to calculate the screen time of each character in a video using face detection and other techniques. The program detects faces in videos, then calculates each person's total time in the video.

## Implementation

The program is written in Python and uses the OpenCV library for face detection. The face detection algorithm is based on the YuNet and uses a pre-trained model to detect faces in the video frames. The program then tracks each face and calculates the total time each person is on screen.

## Data Sources

The project uses video files as input. The videos are in MP4 format and were obtained from [source]. The video data is preprocessed to extract frames for face detection.
